# Semantic Tags
Semantics is the study of reference, meaning, or truth. A semantic HTML element clearly describes the meaning to the browser, user, search engine, and developer. According to Bruce Lawson, the semantic use of HTML elements “enhances accessibility, searchability, internationalization, and interoperability.”

HTML was created as a markup language to describe documents on the early internet. Now it has a lot of design and interactive elements and we must make sure this content is readable to both humans and machines (browser, search engine bots, assistive technologies).

## Benefit of writing Sematic HTML code
- HTML markup will be easy to read, and code is consistent
- Web becomes more accessible since computers are better able to analyze its contents, index it, deliver it
- Accessible to Search engines and assistive technologies (like screen readers, translation tools for users with a sight impairment), understand the context and content of your website.

## Points to remember
- For example: if you add a header don't forget to add a footer and although different websites have different layouts and structures with the help of semantic tags we must try to provide a consistent user experience for all kinds of users.
- Fig. caption vs Alt, they differ from the fact that one is an **alt**ernative (when the image can't be seen) while the other one is a (*fig*)**caption** (and always visible).
- Never use markup/semantic tags for styling (like headings)

## Examples
```html
<header> 
<footer>
<nav>
<aside>
<figure>
<section>
<article>
```
