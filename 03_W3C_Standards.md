# W3C Standards
World Wide Web Consortium is a community that develops open standards to ensure the long-term growth of the web. These standards are free to use, contribute and are available as a public resource.

## Why do we need standards for the web?
The web is made up of many technologies working together, for example, when we open a website in a browser it sends a request to the server which understands and processes the request and sends a response which the browser is able to read and render/display. Imagine the no. of browsers, operating systems, servers, and users from different parts of the world. All of this is made possible as each and every component is able to communicate with the other seamlessly following the W3C standards. These standards are not controlled by any single company/person. This makes sure developers, authors and creators are able to use/build the web free of cost.
