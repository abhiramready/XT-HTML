# W3C Standards
World Wide Web Consortium is a community that develops open standards to ensure the long-term growth of the web. These standards are free to use, contribute and are available as a public resource. The W3C standards are also known as W3C recommendations usually exist as long technical documents on mainly HTML, CSS, and other common web technologies. Following W3C standards will help make our website more accessible to all kinds of users around the world and these standards have also been recognized internationally by many governments. Validating our website with the W3C standards makes it more accessible, efficient, organized, and error-free.

## Why do we need standards for the web?
The web is made up of many technologies working together, for example, when we open a website in a browser it sends a request to the server which understands and processes the request and sends a response which the browser is able to read and render/display. Imagine the no. of browsers, operating systems, servers, and users from different parts of the world. All of this is made possible as each and every component is able to communicate with the other seamlessly following the W3C standards. These standards are not controlled by any single company/person. This makes sure developers, authors and creators are able to use/build the web free of cost.

## Web Accessibility Initiative
The W3C has started the Web Accessibility Initiative to define guidelines for all areas of the web,
- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines for developers and designers to help build accessible web right from the foundations
- User Agent Accessibility Guidelines for user agents (browsers and plugins) ensuring they communicate with other assistive technologies
- Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines to make accessible authoring tools used by (developers, designers, and creators) so that everyone can create content on the web.

## Points to remember
- Web for the people and by the people
- Important/fundamental features of the web should never be behind a paywall (this is why W3C will remain an open and independent community)
- W3C will consider all kinds of users to express their needs and problems on the web (Users with disabilities, poor internet connections, or old devices with lower compute power)
- As developers, we need to be mindful that we can shape the web right from the beginning
