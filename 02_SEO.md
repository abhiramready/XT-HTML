# SEO - Search Engine Optimization
SEO means Search Engine Optimization. We perform some tweaks/optimizations on our site so that search engines like Google can understand our content and display/list our page in relevant search query results. SEO is an important area in web development as it determines the visibility of our site on the web. In the beginning, a few factors like backlinks(links from other sites pointing to our site) are the key for SEO ranking(to rank/display in the first results). However, as the web continued to evolve, now there are hundreds of factors and various algorithms using machine learning and many other metrics that determine a website's ranking i.e the quality of content and relevance to the user search query.

## Role of HTML tags in SEO
HTML tags are an important part of SEO strategy as we can use the meta tags, title tags, and headings, to help the bots and social media sites understand what our site is about. For example, the title tag of our page becomes the link we see on the search results page, the meta description and meta image tags make up the text and the images below are links on the search results page. In short, the meta tags extend the information provided by the title of the page. These tags also aid in displaying rich link previews in our chats and social media platforms.

## Content is King
Now there can be many competitor sites or companies against our site, all of us fighting for the first place on the results page and in the end, only quality content and relevant keywords can boost our SEO. However, forcefully injecting unnecessary or many keywords than required can lower our search rankings due to redundant and spam content just for the sake of SEO ranking. Thus, quality over quantity and target specific audience and keywords.

## SEO Best practices
- Content is King, nothing beats the originality and the authority in the web
- Rendering HTML is the key, although some search engine bots can process JavaScript on the page it is recommended to display HTML ASAP, nobody (both humans and bots) like to wait for a slow page
- HTTPS is a must, Security also affects the search ranking as vulnerable sites cannot be trusted
- With the increasing number of mobile devices all sites must be responsive and accessible even on mobile devices

## Basic SEO Jargons
- SERP = Search Engine Results Pages
- CTR = Click-Through Rate, percentage of clicks/views
- Bounce Rate = Bounce happens when a user leaves a site without visiting any other pages or continuing
- Dwell time/Average session duration = The average time spent by a user on a website/page

## Important tags/factors for SEO
- Title tag

- Headings and their hierarchy
- Media content with ARIA labels and alt tags for accessibility
- URL structure should be readable and simple
- Logical and meaningful website structure, we should be able to navigate to any page through links between pages
- Important keywords should be present on the page but, not too many
- Only text is indexable by bots, therefore focus on the text that appears as soon as we land on a page
- Maintain sitemaps: Sitemap is an XML file that has a list of all the URLs of a site, this helps search engine bots to quickly index(read) the latest content
