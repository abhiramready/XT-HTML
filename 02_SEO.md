# SEO
SEO means Search Engine Optimization. We perform some tweaks/optimizations on our site so that search engines like Google are able to understand our content and display/list our page in appropriate search query results. SEO is an important area in web development as this dertermines the visibility of our site to the entire web.

In the beginning a few factors like backlinks(links from other site pointing to our site) are the key for SEO ranking(to rank/display in the first results). However as people started overusing these factors for better ranking and the web continued to evolve now there are hundreds of factors that determine a websites ranking i.e the quality of content and relevance.

HTML tags are an important part of SEO as we can use the meta tags, title tags and headings, to show bots and machines what our site is about to the bots and social media sites. For example the title tag of our page becomes the link we see in the search results page and the meta description tag and meta image tag shape the text and images below our link in the search results and social media platforms. In short, the meta tags extend info provided by title.
